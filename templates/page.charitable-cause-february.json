At its core is a simple belief: All Lives Can’t Matter Until Black Lives Matter.<\/p><p>Here at Booksio, we believe Black Lives Matter is a social, political, and legal reality grounded in the lived experience of millions of our fellow American citizens. We want to do what we can to make a difference. In honor of Black Americans’ struggles for basic human rights and in the hopes of creating a more equitable and just American society, we will give 10% of all profits to the following transformative organizations:<\/p>",
