In the 1960s and 70s, women’s rights focused on bodily autonomy and the liberation of women’s lived experiences. Today, we’ve seen the increasing politicization of women’s bodies and a fierce debate over trans rights and who gets to call themselves women.<\/p><p>Here at Booksio, we stand with all women. We recognize that women’s rights are human rights. We want to do what we can to make sure that all women’s bodies, minds, and spirits are nurtured and valued. Through hyper local and national organizations, we want to do our part in improving quality of life and increasing opportunities for over half of American citizens. Therefore, during the month of March, we will give 10% of all profits to these fantastic organizations:<\/p>",
