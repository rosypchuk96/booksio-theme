        "text_1": "<p>Based on our customer recommendations, Booksio's December charitable theme tackles the issue of animal welfare. We’re so excited to bring this critical issue to light for our community. Just in case you have not been paying attention, the world’s animals are in crisis. Here are some startling statistics:<\/p><p>Each year, approximately 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized in the United States.<\/p><p>Every year poachers take more than 38 million animals from the wilds of Brazil to meet the global demand for illegal wildlife. Most are birds destined to become caged pets for people in Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, Madrid or New York.<\/p><p>The population of wildlife throughout the world decreased in size by approximately 52 percent between 1970 and 2010. The human population more than doubled in size during the period.<\/p>",
        "text_2": "<p>At Booksio, we believe the world’s biodiversity is one of our greatest, most precious gifts. Whether in the United States or around the world, we have a responsibility to make sure animals are treated humanely. From family pets to global wildlife, we hope that our contributions this month are able to create a more just and sustainable future for all creatures.<\/p><p>During December, Booksio is proud to give 10% of all book and magazine sales to the following charities:<\/p><p><strong>Humane Society of the United States<\/strong>– Since 1954, the Humane Society has fought against animal cruelty both in our local communities and around the world. Whether they are working to stop puppy mills, end cosmetic animal testing, or ban trophy hunting, the Humane Society has been fighting for all animals lives.<\/p>",
        "text_3": "<p><strong>World Wildlife Fund<\/strong>– As the world’s leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. WWF focuses their efforts on those species—like tigers, rhinos, whales and marine turtles—whose protection influences and supports the survival of other species or offers the opportunity to protect whole landscapes or marine areas.<\/p><p><strong>Ocean Conservancy<\/strong>– For over fifty years, Ocean Conservancy has worked to protect the ocean from today’s greatest global challenges. From plastic cleanup and coral reef rehabilitation to sustainable fisheries and climate change, Ocean Conservancy creates evidence-based solutions for a healthy ocean and the wildlife and communities that depend on it.<\/p><p>Want to learn more about the complex issues around animal welfare? From funny memoirs to profound exposés, these books will keep the learning going.<\/p>",
